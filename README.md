# Ants-Vs.-SomeBees

In this project, I created an immersive tower defense game called Ants Vs. SomeBees, drawing inspiration from the popular title, [Plants Vs. Zombies](https://www.ea.com/studios/popcap/plants-vs-zombies) by PopCap Games. Leveraging my expertise in functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, I showcased my programming skills by developing an engaging game that involves understanding, extending, and testing a complex codebase.

As the mastermind behind the ant colony, players take on the role of the ant queen, entrusted with the crucial task of defending the colony against relentless bee invaders. Through strategic deployment of diverse ant units, each with their unique abilities, I have created a challenging gameplay experience that requires players to devise effective defense strategies. By skillfully throwing leaves to irritate the bees, players can vanquish them and protect the queen from their wrath.

Throughout this project, I have demonstrated my proficiency in functional and object-oriented programming, meticulously crafting game mechanics, implementing intricate interactions between game elements, and optimizing the overall gameplay for an immersive experience. I have also expanded upon the existing codebase, ensuring seamless functionality and conducting thorough testing to deliver a polished and enjoyable gaming experience.

With the Ants Vs. SomeBees [Tower Defense](https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tower_defense) Game, I aim to captivate players with beautiful GUI, strategic decision-making, and exciting challenges. I invite players to embark on an epic journey of defending the ant colony against the invading bees.
